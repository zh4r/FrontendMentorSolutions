## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

- Learned about Enter key functionality.
- Learned about email validation regex and functions.
- First I made 2 html files for the mail input page and the success message page, but then I decided to consolidate them into a single page and hide/show the main page and the success message.

### Continued development

- I love JS! I want more!
- I think my CSS is very messy and confusing, I need to work on that.
